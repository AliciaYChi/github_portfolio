<h3> Statement</h3>
<body>
<p>This is a mix of the Hololive entertainers Ameilia Watson, Hakos Baelz, and Ouro Kronni. It references the content creators' personal lore through the usage of popular meme. The mash-up uses the "Fat Rat being Grabbed" meme, "Goku Drip" meme, "Chibi Amelia/Smol Ame"  , and "Woman Yelling at a Cat".

  For reference, Kronni is the epitome of time (but had her design turned into a the meme of a helicopter by her community), while Baelz is a rat that is chaos. Amelia Watson is a time traveling detective who stole a clock from Kronni and starts causing issues across many timelines. The many Small Ames' are different Amelias from different timelines.
